# Travelling Salesman & API Data Extraction

In this project, I will cover these topics:
- APIs
- Pandas
- Processing special data types in Python

I will work with these APIs:
1. [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started)
2. [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro)

The main goal of the project is to build a database of golf courses in Calgary using the YELP API and optimize the trip time to the top 10 courses using the Google API.
The project consists of the following tasks:

- Pull the data through an API.
- Setup data frames to obtain insights from the data.
- Choose the top golf courses based on popularity (number of reviews or average rating) ([Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business).
- Implementing [travelling salesman problem (TSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem), how much time would it take to visit all of these golf courses?
