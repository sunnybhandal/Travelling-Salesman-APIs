# Mini-project II
The details for the miniproject from Week 2


In this miniproject, I will combine and practice topics that we have learned in the previous two weeks:
- APIs
- Pandas
- Processing special data types in Python

I will work with these APIs:
1. [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started)
2. [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro)

The main goal of the mini-project is to build the database of restaurants, bars and golf courses in Calgary using the YELP API.
The project consists of following tasks:

- pull the data through an API.
- o
- choose the top golf courses based on popularity (number of reviews or average rating) ([Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business).

- By implementing [travelling salesman problem (TSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem), how much time would it take to visit all of these golf courses? ([Directions API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/start) from google will be helpful here). We will have to find travel time between all places (top 10). We can use [ortools](https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing/tsp) from Google to effectively implement TSP. These tools are very powerful and [easy to install](https://developers.google.com/optimization/install).
